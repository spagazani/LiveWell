//LiveWell//

~Project Description~
LiveWell aims to help people take care of themselves and engage in a healthy, ergonomic lifestyle, especially those who spend long hours at their desks. Our program provides customizable alarms for important reminders like drinking water and taking breaks. There is also a resource directory where users can learn stretches, good posture, and more. We strived to put an emphasis on good physical health as well as good mental health.

As beginner programmers, we coded our project in Python3, as we hoped it's simple syntax keep our challenges mostly related to logic and problem solving. For GUI, we chose PySimpleGUI to create an interactive interface for users to navigate our project. This way we could present a prototype of our project that was easy to use. We used Figma for the design premise for what this project would look like if it were fully fleshed out.

The programmers on our team are both first years, with no previous hackathon experience, and thus we were learning every step of the way and had to adapt our project to those curves.
